### The sign in feature still have a bug
### But it actually works, 
### After you click sign in, the loading dialog will appear and you will stuck at that screen
### At this moment, your sign in session is exist
### I've add some validation in splash page to check if the user have been sign in before (check the firebase instance)
### In order to access the home page, you must perform hot-restart and the app will go to splash page again to check
